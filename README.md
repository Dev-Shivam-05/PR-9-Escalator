# PR-9-Escalator

# 🚀 Escalator – Stack & Queue Project

## 🧾 Project Description

This project contains two separate C++ implementations to simulate an "Escalator" system using:
1. **Stack**
2. **Queue**
The goal is to demonstrate how different data structures manage data flow (LIFO vs FIFO) and apply core object-oriented programming principles.

## 💡 Key Features

- Demonstrates the difference between Stack and Queue behaviors.
- Implements OOP principles:
  - **Class & Object**
  - **Encapsulation**
  - **Inheritance** (if used for shared behavior)
  - **Polymorphism** (where applicable)

## 📌 Implementations

### 🔷 1. Stack-Based Escalator
**Characteristics:**
- Follows **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) approach.
- Built using arrays.
- Key operations:
  - `push()`: Add element to the top.
  - `pop()`: Remove top element.
  - `top()`: Peek at the top without removing.
  - `isEmpty()`: Check if stack is empty.
  - `isFull()`: Check if stack is full.
- Encapsulated in a class structure.
---

### 🔶 2. Queue-Based Escalator
**Characteristics:**
- Follows **FIFO** (First In, First Out) principle.
- Built using arrays.
- Key operations:
  - `enqueue()`: Add element at the rear.
  - `dequeue()`: Remove element from the front.
  - `peek()`: Show the front element.
  - `isEmpty()`: Check if queue is empty.
  - `isFull()`: Check if queue is full.
- Structured using proper class encapsulation.
